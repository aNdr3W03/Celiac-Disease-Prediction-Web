Therefore, it is important for you to understand these risks and monitor any symptoms or health changes that may appear in the future.

							<div class="fw-bold">Management and Prevention</div>
							Although patients may not require a gluten-free diet at this time, those with potential celiac disease are advised to have regular monitoring with a doctor or nutritionist. If you experience symptoms or signs of celiac disease in the future, management options include adopting a gluten-free diet to prevent further damage to the intestines and reduce celiac symptoms such as diarrhea, nausea, constipation, bloating and abdominal pain. There are several foods that you can avoid that contain gluten, such as grains, wheat, barley, spelled, kamut, and rye.

				<p class="mb-0">It is important to note that if you have potential celiac disease you may have genetic differences that make you susceptible to the disease, but over time, with enough gluten exposure, you may actually develop active celiac disease. Therefore, regular medical monitoring and consultation is essential for potential management of celiac disease.</p>
